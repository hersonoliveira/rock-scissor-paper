# Rock Paper Scissors

* As the possible hands of the game (paper, rock, scissors) are constants, I choose an enum class to represent it.
* All hand match outcomes are tested.
* Game setup is easy to understand.
* If a change on the match rules is needed, like choose certain hands on specific rounds, the game class will need to be refactored.
